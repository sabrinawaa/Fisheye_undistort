chessoard/: pics with handdrawn grids

gridpoints/: grid points coordinantes of above grids

4models.py: taking panorama as fisheye lens, using distortion equations from different fisheye lens to undistort.see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens

c2S.py: method try to remap ellipse to rectangle, doesn't work yet

calibrate.py: calibrate camera using chessboard pics, example copied from online

chessboard.py: using grid points I drew to try calirate camera, first half is saving the data

fisheye_cali.py: duplicate of trial_param should delete later

grid_detection.py: using gridlines I drew detect grid points. Works but points need sorting.

line_detectio.py: detect lines in image, not used cuz too many lines detected

optimisation.py: minimising distance of grid points of hand-drawn grids and ideal grid points to get matrix and dist params.

trial_chinese.py: another example from online using chessboard method. can ignore

trial_params.py: trying by hand. seconnd + third block is using one method with dist involving only [k1,k2,k3,k4]. last block uses another method with dist = [k1,k2,p1,p2,k3]

trial_using_defisheye.py: existing module doesnt work in our case as its panorama.
